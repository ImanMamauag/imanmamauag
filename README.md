## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my 90-day Data Analytics Job-Ready Plan 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to create data analytics projects using SQL, Python, and Power BI to transform data into valuable business insights.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on real-world data analysis projects, open-source analytics tools, or business intelligence dashboards.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with gaining hands-on experience in end-to-end data projects, especially in data engineering workflows and advanced analytics techniques.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, dashboard building, or how to turn raw numbers into actionable insights.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: i.mamauag@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once spent hours cleaning a dataset for funâ€”turns out, I enjoy solving messy data puzzles as much as solving escape room challenges.
